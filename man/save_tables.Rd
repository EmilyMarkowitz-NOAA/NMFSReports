save_tables(
  table_raw = NULL,
  table_print = NULL,
  list_tables = c(),
  header = "",
  footnotes = "",
  filename0 = "x",
  cnt_chapt_content = "001",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{table_raw}{Optional. The data.frame that has no rounding and no dividing of numbers (good to save this for record keeping). Default = NA.}

\item{table_print}{The data.frame as table will be seen in the report.}

\item{list_tables}{Save tables in a list}

\item{header}{The name and title of the figure. Default = "".}

\item{footnotes}{Any footnote you want attached to this figure.}

\item{filename0}{The filename set at the begining of the chapter}

\item{cnt_chapt_content}{The order number that this exists in the chapter.}

\item{cnt}{The figure number}

\item{path}{The path the file needs to be saved to. Default = "NULL", meaning it wont save anything and will override all other saving elements.}

\item{output_type}{Default = c("csv"). Can be anything supported by utils::write.table.}

\item{type}{Default = "Table", but can be anything that the element needs to be called (e.g., "Graphic", "Fig.", "Graph") to fit in the phrase "Table 1. This is my spreadsheet!".}

\item{alttext}{String with what the alternative text is.}

\item{filename_desc}{Additional description text for the filename that will be added at the name of file before the filename extention, before the "_raw" or "_print". Default = "". Can be use to add a species name, location, or anything else that would make it easier to know what that file shows.}

\item{nickname}{A unique name that can be used to identify the figure so it can be referenced later in the report.}

\item{message}{TRUE/FALSE. Default = FALSE. If TRUE, it will print information about where your plot has been saved to.}
