  cnt = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{figure}{The figure you would like to be saved.}

\item{list_figures}{The list where all figures will be saved.}

\item{header}{The name and title of the figure. Default = "".}

\item{footnotes}{Any footnote you want attached to this figure.}

\item{filename0}{The filename set at the begining of the chapter.}

\item{cnt_chapt_content}{The order number that this exists in the chapter.}

\item{cnt}{The figure number.}

\item{path}{The path the file needs to be saved to. Default = "NULL", meaning it wont save anything and will override all other saving elements.}

\item{width}{Default = 6 inches.}

\item{height}{Default = 6 inches.}

\item{output_type}{Default = c("pdf", "png"). Can be anything supported by ggsave().}

\item{type}{Default = "Figure", but can be anything that the element needs to be called (e.g., "Graphic", "Fig.", "Graph") to fit in the phrase "Figure 1. This is my plot!".}

\item{alttext}{String with what the alternative text is.}

\item{filename_desc}{Additional description text for the filename that will be added at the name of file before the filename extention. Can be use to add a species name, location, or anything else that would make it easier to know what that file shows.}

\item{nickname}{A unique name that can be used to identify the figure so it can be referenced later in the report.}

\item{raw}{Optional. The data.frame or other data that has no rounding and no dividing of numbers (good to save this for record keeping) and was used to create the figure. Default = NA.}

\item{message}{TRUE/FALSE. Default = FALSE. If TRUE, it will print information about where your plot has been saved to.}
